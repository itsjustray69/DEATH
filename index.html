        Murder
    </header>
    <p>
        Murder is the unlawful killing of another
         human without justification or valid excuse, especially 
         the unlawful killing of another human with malice aforethought.
          This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction,
           distinguish murder from
         other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter.
    </p>
    <ul class="small-bois">
        <li>Homicide is an act in which a person
             kills another person. A homicide requires only a volitional
              act or an omission that causes the death of another,<br /> and
               thus 
              a homicide may result from accidental,
             reckless, or negligent acts even if there
              is no intent to cause harm.</li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Manslaughter is a common law legal term for 
                homicide considered by law as less culpable than murder. 
                The distinction between murder and manslaughter is sometimes said 
                to have first been made by the ancient Athenian lawmaker Draco in 
                the 7th
                 century BC. The definition of manslaughter differs among legal
                  jurisdictions.

    suicide
</header>
<p>
    Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. some causes
     of  Suicide include Mental disorders and physical disorders. Some
      suicides are impulsive acts due to stress and relationship/friendship
       issues  
</p>
<ul class="small-bois">
    <li>Stress can be defined as a state of worry or mental
         tension caused by a difficult situation. Stress is a natural human response that prompts
          us to address challenges and threats in our lives.</li>
          <br />
    <li>
        A physical disability is a limitation on a person's physical functioning, mobility, dexterity or stamina. Other physical disabilities 
        include impairments which limit other facets of daily living, such as respiratory disorders, blindness, epilepsy and sleep disorders.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        Mental illness, also called mental health disorders,
         refers to a wide range of mental health conditions â€” disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior.
         Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
        Relationship and friendship issues are a very common cause of suicide mostly because if people are getting emotional abused by everyoe 
        in their life that just makes it even harder to get help which will eventually lead to self harm, mental health issues and even suicide 
        if they don't get help on their mental health because if everyone in your life is against you, you won't tell anyone about whats going 
        on which will lead to you stuffing everything down and trying your best to not show your emotions and whether you like it or not This
        all soon leads to suicide. the sad thing about this is that most people don't know whats going on they might even think that they are making your life a good place 
        so they will just continue with everything
        like its normal or even take things up to a new level sometimes it feels like they're mad that you exist and are doing their best to 
        make you want to kill yourself so this type of environment is a big factor when it comes to suicide especially teenage suicide 
        because if your own family the people you deepend on treats you like this whats the point of trying.

        Toxins
    </header>
    <p>
        A toxin is a naturally occurring organic poison produced by metabolic activities of living cells or organisms.
         They occur especially as proteins, often conjugated.
         The term was first used by organic chemist Ludwig Brieger and is derived from the word "toxic".
    </p>
 <p>
    Most toxins are fat soluble and
     end up stored in fatty tissues in our bodies like our brains, nerves, glands and yes, that extra layer around our tummies and thighs.
